Agri-food Data Canada supports the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) specification for writing machine-readable data schemas.

One feature of OCA is that users can create a format overlay which is the rules of which format the data can be in. For example, the data in a specific column must have a number between 0 and 1, or data must be well-formed Canadian postal codes etc.

Writing format rules can be complicated. To support users Agri-food Data Canada provides pre-selected lists of different types of valid format rules for schema creators.
